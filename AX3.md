# Open Movement - AX3 Movement logging sensors #

AX3 is a fully waterproof data logging device which feature a MEMS 3-axis accelerometer and flash-based on-board memory.  It is designed to collect data in non-lab based environments -- capable of recording raw accelerometer values at 100 Hz for 14 days.

The AX3 also incorporate a real time quartz clock, temperature sensor and light sensor.  They are programmable for interval recording, accelerometer sensitivity and sampling rate.  Data download, configuration and battery recharging is over USB.

The AX3 appears as a USB device with two interfaces: a standard "mass storage drive", which contains the data file (in an open format), and a "communications device class" serial terminal for configuration.
