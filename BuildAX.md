# Open Movement - BuildAX Building Monitoring #

The BuildAX wireless sensors measure building environment/occupancy and include temperature, humidity, light and movement.

The BuildAX family of sensors, actuators and a logger/router are made available under an open license.  The devices were developed within a joint research project undertaken by [Newcastle University's Digital Interaction Group](http://di.ncl.ac.uk/) and [Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/energy/) and [Strathclyde University's Energy Systems Research Unit](http://www.strath.ac.uk/esru/).

The devices can be rapidly deployed to enable low cost built environment monitoring, and are fully compatible with the Open Source EnTrak(tm) system as a means to deploy 'eServices' for systems conditions monitoring, occupant feedback, performance certification and the like.
